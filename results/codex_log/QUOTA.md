# Quota and runtime

- 2026-10-24 15:17:38 UTC: user reports approximately 24% session quota remaining. Finish and push each started gate before beginning another. Long jobs use `nohup`; poll no more than once per five minutes.
- Gate A started 2026-10-24 15:17:38 UTC; analysis completed 2026-10-24 15:55 UTC. Stop after Gate A if remaining quota is insufficient to complete five-seed Gate B and its commit/push.
- 2026-10-24 15:58 UTC: stop after pushed Gate A; remaining session quota is insufficient to safely finish, commit and push the five-seed Gate B plus its longer runs. Gate B and C remain NOT RUN.
